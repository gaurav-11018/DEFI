Decentralized-Finance.

Decentralized finance offers financial instruments without relying on intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks by using smart contracts on a blockchain.

This project illustrates three functionalities of DeFi:
1.  Depositing ETH, and gain interest on the principal.
2.  Borrowing ETH/DAI(stable coin).
3.  Approve the amount that can be borrowed calculating the risk factor.


Defi-Tools used:

* Aave Protocol
* Uniswap
